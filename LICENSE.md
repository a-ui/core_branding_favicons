EULA / End User License Agreement

THIS IS A LEGAL AGREEMENT. By downloading and/or installing
Antwerpen font family software you agree to the following terms:

1. Installation, locations, portable devices
This licence is only for the benefit of the users authorised under
this licence. Authorised users are permitted to install and use the
font software on one (1) portable device such as a notebook or
laptop computer and on one (1) desktop or workstation type device
that remains at a single location. For example 5 users are
authorised to install and use the font software on their five (5)
portable devices and their five (5) desktop or workstation type
devices in a single location. These computers can be connected to
any number of output devices, such as laser printers, ink jet
printers, an image setter or a film recorder. The font software may
be downloaded to the memory (hard disk or RAM) of the output devices
that are customarily used by you for the purposes of having such
font software remain resident in the output devices. If you need to
install the Font Software on more than the authorized computers
permitted by this licence, or if more users need to use the font
software, you are required to upgrade to a multiple user licence.
You further agree to treat the software as confidential information
and exercise reasonable care to avoid unauthorised distribution of
the Font Software. If you cannot or do not agree to the terms of
this licence, return the software unused to Studio Type / Jo De
Baerdemaeker, Gounodstraat 8/31, 2018 Antwerpen, Belgium.
This means that the standard licence allows only a single user to
use the fonts. If more users plan to use the fonts, you need to
upgrade the licence to cover multiple users.

2. Service Bureau
To reproduce a particular document at a commercial printer, or
service bureau, you can supply non-editable artwork in a PDF format.
If the printer or service bureau needs to install the fonts on their
computers they will need to purchase a separate Service Bureau
licence.
This means that to output your documents you can either send non-
editable PDF files, or your printer / service bureau / designer can
get a separate licence at a significant discount.

3. Rights reserved
The Font Software and the designs embodied therein are the exclusive
property of Studio Type / Jo De Baerdemaeker. This non-exclusive,
revocable licence grants you certain limited rights to use the font
software only, no permanent or ownership rights are granted as a

to the font software, the designs of the fonts embodied therein
together with the copyrights, trademarks, trade names and service
marks associated with the font software are each the exclusive
property of Studio Type / Jo De Baerdemaeker.
This means that by buying the licence you only buy the right to use
the fonts. The fonts themselves remain the exclusive property of
Studio Type / Jo De Baerdemaeker.

4. Modifications, back-up copies

by a separate written agreement, you may not modify, adapt,

Software will be used, an additional licence upgrade and/or the
purchase of a special licence may be required. A special OEM licence

electronic books, game playing devices, gaming or gambling devices
irrespective of whether the font software itself is embedded into
the device or whether it is merely the designs of the fonts that are
displayed. If you are using the Font Software in exhibition or
display in cinemas, motion pictures, on television or on cable
television, or as a part of any works broadcast or transmitted on

Software over the Internet in font serving or for font replacement
